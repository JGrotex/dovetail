### Introduction
The dovetail cli is a tool to mainly generate smart contracts for a given model built using ui tool [Dovetail Studio](../getting-started-webui), so we recommend you to learn how to do that first.

### Before you get started
Before you can get started with the cli tools you need to make sure you have the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed. Go v1.11.x is required.

{{% notice info %}}
Don't forget to set your `GOPATH` variable and make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is part of your path. (see [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) for more details)
