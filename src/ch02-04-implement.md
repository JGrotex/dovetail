## 3. Implement IOU Smart Contract
In this step, we will implement the 4 transactions defined in the smart contract model in Project Dovetail™ Studio. A completed iou smart contract is also available to be imported into the Studio, see step [3.6](ch02-04-implement.html#36-import-an-existing-application) for details.

### 3.1 IssueIOU Transaction*

> * Go to Apps Tab > Create to create a new Application "IOU"

> * Create a flow > flow name "IssueIOU" > Select "SmartContract TXN Trigger" > Select "IOU" from model dropdown > Select "com.example.iou.IssueIOU" from transaction dropdown > Click "Done" button

> * We will add a logger activity, ledger activity and response activity. We will also validate input before writing to ledger.

### 3.2 TransferIOU Transaction*

> * Create a new flow to implement TransferIOU transaction

### 3.3 getIOU Transaction*

> * Create a new flow to implement getIOU transaction

### 3.4 getIOUIssuedBy Transaction*

> * Create a new flow to implement getIOUIssuedBy transaction
> * We use "Custom Query" activity to query the ledger. This activity is **NOT blockchain agnostic**
>    - define a input parameter "issuerId"
>    - define blochchain specific query string, use _$paramName for input substitution, in this example, we use [Hyperledger Fabric CouchDB query syntax](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/couchdb_tutorial.html)
   
> During the mapping of transaction response, you will notice tht "array." is underlined with a red line, it is a UI validation error because Project Dovetail™ Studio UI does not support function yet, the error has no impact to runtime. Function will be supported in the very near future.

### 3.5 SettleIOU Transaction*

> * Create a new flow to implement SettleIOU transaction
> * Add General/Mapper activity to calculate remaining balance using math.subtractLong(), 
Dovetail math functions are exact, exception will be raised if overflow or underflow is detected.
> * If remaining balance is equal or greater than requested payment
>    * Add SmartContract-Corda/Payment activity to handle Cash payment processing, this flow will only run on R3 Corda. 
>    * Add SmartContract/Ledger activity to update IOU's paid amount
> * Otherwise, return error

### 3.6. Import an existing application

> * You can also import an application into Project Dovetail™ Studio
>     * Go to Project Dovetail™ Studio
>     * If you haven't import iou.bna file from Connections tab, you can do so now following [this step](ch02-03-import.md)
>     * Create a new Application "IOUImport", click on "Import" button, use this [IOU.json](tutorials/iou/IOU.json)
